#### Token Burning and Delegation

- Burning tokens reduces the total supply of a token by removing them from circulation.
- Approving a delegate, allows another account to transfer or burn a specified amount of tokens from a token account while retaining original account ownership.
- Revoking a delegate, removes their authority to act on behalf of the token account owner.
- Each of these operations is facilitated through the spl-token library, utilizing specific functions for each action.
